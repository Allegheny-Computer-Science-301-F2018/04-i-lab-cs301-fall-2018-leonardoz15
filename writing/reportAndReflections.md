Question 7.
The first disease I found to be directly affected by the introduction of vaccinations was mumps. The article presented by the CDC
stated there was a 99% decrease in mumps cases since the mumps vaccination program started in 1967. The source was definitely credible
considering they have been reporting mumps cases long before the vaccinations were made. They also have very recent data of mumps outbreaks as close as September 2018.

The second disease I researched was chickenpox aka varicella. I found another article from the CDC with data specifically about the effect of the varicella vaccination on outbreaks in the US. The article states that before the vaccination became available in 1995, roughly 4 million people were diagnosed with varicella just in the early 1990s. Once 95% of children and adolescents were given the vaccination, varying from state to state, 3.5 million cases are prevented each year along with 9000 hospitalizations and 100 fatal cases. For the same reasons I mentioned about the first article, this article is also credible, not to mention that it is specifically focused on the effects of the vaccination.

Question 8.
When the misuse of data leads to the spread of false but convincing studies it can have damaging effects on reputation, as it did with public medicine in this example. Parents stopped vaccinating their kids and public opinion about vaccinations and the doctors who created them turned negative. This was a problem since the vaccinations were for possibly fatal diseases and were working exactly how they should, but were being boycotted for no reason.

There should be a series of skeptical scientists dedicated to in depth analyzation of popular public articles like Dr. Wakefield's. As the NYT article mentioned, it is extremely hard to prove a comprehensive study wrong, and it can be very convincing for someone inexperienced. In addition, activist groups shouldn't rely so heavily on articles that weren't analyzed in this way first to help stop the flow of misinformation.

In the short term, retraction is not enough to fix the damage already done to the reputation of public medicine. Counter-studies take time to build and public opinion takes a while to fluctuate. In addition, even if people don't believe in the article, there could still be a feeling of uncertainty in the medical process However in a decade or so, new research will surpass the misinformation, and everyone will forget about Dr. Wakefield's article.

Question 9.
I decided to research the Rubella disease data from the World Health Organization. The data had a count of reported cases in varying regions of the world per year starting in 1997 until the present. As the rubella vaccination became available in 2004, reported cases have completely dropped off in America going from 4500 cases in 2008 to only 18 in 2009. Other regions where the vaccinations cant be distributed as easily aren't effected by the vaccinations as drastically, but are still reduced.

I also researched tetanus using the reported cases of total tetanus by country provided by the WHO. The vaccination for tetanus has been available since 1940 and so the amount of reported incidents and deaths have decreased drastically since then. According to the data, there hasn't been a recorded case in the US since 2015 and for some countries, the past decade.
